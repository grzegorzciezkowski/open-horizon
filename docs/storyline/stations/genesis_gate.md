# Genesis Gate

## 🪐 Location
Stable gravitational point in the **Eos-7** star system.

## 🏗️ General Overview
Genesis Gate is a monumental ring-shaped structure floating in deep space, constructed by a long-lost civilization known only as the Antecedents. From the outside, it resembles a massive, distorted ring of blackened metals, laced with ancient energy cores and dormant runes. The inner mechanisms are largely unknown, though the central core activates periodically to open a spacetime portal – but only one way: into the Lambda Sector.

The Gate serves as a one-way colonization portal – anyone who passes through cannot return. Though the entry point is monitored by the Coalition of the Three Human Factions, no one truly understands the technology or the true origin of Genesis Gate.
