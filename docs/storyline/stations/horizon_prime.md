# Horizon Prime

## 🪐 Location
Built in orbit around the planet **Thera**, in the **Eos-7** star system, just beyond the exit point of the Genesis Gate—a massive, ancient, one-way space-time portal. Horizon Prime is the first contact point for all newcomers entering the Lambda sector.

## 🏗️ General Overview
Horizon Prime is a massive, modular space station that serves as:

- the administrative center,
- a transit hub,
- the starting point for all new players,
-  neutral diplomatic zone.

Constructed through a joint effort of the three human factions after the **First Exodus**, it symbolizes both cooperation—and necessity—in the face of the unknown. Each faction has its own wing on the station, but it is governed by an autonomous council and port-side AI operating under strict neutrality protocols.
