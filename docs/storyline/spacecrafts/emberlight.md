# Emberlight

A small, multipurpose scout-class vessel designed for lone pioneers venturing beyond the Genesis Gate. Though its silhouette may seem modest compared to the giants of galactic fleets, it was ships like this that ushered in a new era in the Lambda sector. Equipped with an adaptive pulse engine, a basic mining system, and light weaponry, the Emberlight embodies what matters most: beginnings, courage, and an unyielding will to survive.
