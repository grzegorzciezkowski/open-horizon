# 2025-09-01 How to store translations?
## Context
We need to store translations in a way that allows us to easily update them.

## Decision
We decided to use a JSON file stored in the StreamingAssets folder. StreamingAssets folder is automatically copied to the build folder.

We decided to store arrays of Key-Value pairs because Unity JSON parser doesn't support dictionaries.

We decided to split translations into separate files for each language and category.

The path of the file is: `Assets/StreamingAssets/Lang/{category}.{language}.json`

## Consequences
We need to update the JSON file manually or use a tool to do it.

We have to load the new file every time we change the language.

## Other possible options
We could use native Unity support to store translations. However, we decided to store in that way because it will be faster for people who know C# and they don't need to learn how to use String Tables in Unity.

We could put all translations into a single file, but we don't need to keep in the memory all translations at the same time, so we decided to split them into separate files.
